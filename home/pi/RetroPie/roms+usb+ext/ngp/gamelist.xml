		<name>King of Fighters - R-1</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters: R1 marks SNK's first time bringing the KOF series onto a handheld... and what better system than their own Neo Geo Pocket to do just that? 14 of the most well known KOF characters make their appearance in KOF: R-1, along with some recognizable backgrounds and gameplay features based on The King of Fighters '97. Players can choose from "Extra" &amp; "Advance" play modes similar to KOF '97, and most characters play closely to their original versions.</desc>

		<name>Neo Cherry Master</name>
		<desc>Neo Cherry Master is a virtual slot machine simulator for the Neo Geo Pocket. The game simulates the old fashioned fruit-matching slots (infamously known as one-armed bandits), where the player simply "pulls the lever" and leaves the rest up to chance. The game features two modes, Simple and Original mode, with the only difference being that the latter allows for name entry and the ability to save high scores.</desc>

		<path>./Neo Geo Cup '98.zip</path>
		<name>NeoGeo Cup '98</name>
		<desc>Neo Geo Cup '98: The Road to the Victory is a soccer video game based on the FIFA World Cup 1998, despite being released after the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It features 73 teams' countries. Each team enters a "Regional Qualifying Round Final" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). Its slogan is "We got the kick".</desc>

		<path>./Samurai Shodown! I.zip</path>
		<name>Samurai Spirits!</name>
		<desc>Samurai Shodown! Pocket is essentially a "pocket sized" version of Samurai Shodown 4. Much like the rest of the fighting games on the Neo Geo Pocket, the characters are drawn in super-deformed chibi style (big heads and tiny bodies). This title was also one of the first games for the Neo Geo Pocket, so the game was only in black &amp; white... ironically suiting for a "samurai" game. The art style is definitely on the "cutesy" side and much different than any Samurai Shodown game before it, but it can grow on you if you give it a chance.    The classic Samurai Shodown gameplay made the jump to the handheld layout fairly well, but it's not nearly as smooth as Neo Geo arcade classic. The gameplay is particularly slower and very simplified in this version. Characters retain most of their specials and super moves but the deeper gameplay strategies from the arcade iterations are pretty much gone. It's basically a new game all together and it's nothing spectacular, but it's fun for a handheld title.</desc>
