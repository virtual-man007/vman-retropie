    <name>Alien Trilogy</name>
    <desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.  Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.  Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

    <desc>Regardless of a sports game's features, it lives or dies by two things: play control and graphics. All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas is a good example of a feature-heavy game that has adequate play control and adequate graphics. The end result: an adequate game that lacks the polish and finesse needed to be great.nnnnAll-Star Baseball features all 30 Major League teams, including the new Tampa Bay and Arizona teams; over seven hundred real MLB players; 28 stadiums to play in; the complete 1997 schedule, including the new interleague games; player trades; and 27 category statistics from STATS, Inc. In addition, there are six modes of gameplay: exhibition, season, playoffs, all-star game, home run derby, and batting practice. In terms of features it is definitely on par with the other titles out there.</desc>

    <path>./A+M+O+K (USA).chd</path>
    <name>Amok</name>
    <desc>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people." The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.  Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.  The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</desc>

    <desc>This is the home port of the popular arcade light gun game. This home version has special bonuses and additional secret levels not found in the arcade. Using a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.  As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.</desc>

    <desc>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.  Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).  The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.</desc>

It adds an additional secret character as well as a story mode for each character. These additions also hint at some of the plot twists in the game's sequel Battle Arena Toshinden 2.  The games graphics took a huge hit in the port; the Playstation version really does look considerably better. Though the character model and arena for the afore mentioned port exclusive character looks notably better than the ported graphics.  Toshinden Remix also redubs all the games voice samples with more light-hearted samples with over the top and arguably outrageous accents.  Like the graphics, the game speed also takes a huge hit in this port running considerably slower than the Playstation original.</desc>

But who is behind the disappearances, and for what purpose? All of the fighters came to the Toshinden Tournament for different reasons, but they are all fighting for the same reason now: SURVIVAL.</desc>

    <desc>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.  Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals.   Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</desc>

    <desc>Link 3 or more colored bubbles by shooting an identical colored bubble. When they are joined together, they pop.  This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).</desc>

    <name>Clockwork Knight : Pepperouchau's Adventure</name>
    <desc>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.  The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.  Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.</desc>

    <name>Command &amp; Conquer</name>
    <desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.  The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.  In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.  The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

The FMV segments were produced by A Commotion Pictures and use the TrueMotion S video codec.    The game was featured in Episode 13 of Broken Pixels.</desc>

    <desc>Contra: Legacy of War is a 3D action game produced by Konami and developed by Appaloosa Interactive that was originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was the first of two Contra games that were externally developed by Appaloosa, followed by C: The Contra Adventure in 1998. The game marks the series' jump to three-dimensional graphics and controversial changes in gameplay. Legacy of War was released packaged with a pair of 3D anaglyph glasses, which the game supported. Legacy of War bears the distinction for being the first console game in the series to retain both the Contra title and human characters during its release in Europe and Australia (where the console series has been known as Probotector from the first NES game and up until Contra: Hard Corps). The game was scheduled to be released in Japan as well,[1] but was canceled.</desc>

The quality of the full motion video on the Sega-CD version is less than that of the others. Also, after the release of the Sega-CD version, Digital Pictures created an option to have English subtitles during the full motion video as critics had complained that it was difficult to understand what the driver was saying in the Sega-CD and Sega 32X versions.    Footage from the game was later recycled for the 2003 film Game Over.</desc>

    <desc>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.  The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</desc>

The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.  D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

    <desc>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.  These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer).   On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.</desc>

    <desc>The first in the Dead or Alive series, and features many of the same features that has made the DoA series so popular today; somewhat realistic combat, good character design, and scantily clad women whose breasts bounce a lot.  The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space.  Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.  (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)</desc>

    <desc>Athlete Kings is a conversion of the 1995 Sega coin-op Decathlete in which you get to compete in all 10 events involved in a Decathlon. The game is split into two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all 10 events in standard order.   Points are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game.  In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.</desc>

    <desc>All contact is lost with a submarine on a routine mission which then crashes into an underwater facility. The occupants of the underwater facility are ordered to board the submarine and find out what went wrong. On board the vessel, strange things are happening which are taking control of the crew. The crew are mutating due to an alien parasite and members of the search team have to figure out what is happening and how to stop it!   The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.</desc>

    <name>Defcon 5 : Peace Has a Price...</name>
    <desc>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.  The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.  A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success.   As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</desc>

    <desc>A conversion of Sega AM1's arcade 3D scrolling fighting game based on the first Die Hard movie. One or two players work their way up and down a skyscraper in attempting to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter. A large number of fighting moves are available through the simple controls of punch, kick and jump, plus movement. Many weapons are available from knives and broken bottles to machine guns and rocket launchers. Other objects can be picked up and used as weapons such as chairs, an aerosol and lighter combo and even a grandfather clock! Between several of the stages are reaction tests that require a button to be pressed quickly, usually punch, kick or jump. Failure means an extra fight has to be won often with little or no reward in terms of items. The climax sees the heroes fighting the mastermind (who has many swords on his person) on the roof of the skyscraper. Also included is an old Sega arcade game, Deep Scan, used to gain extra credits for the main game.</desc>

    <name>Doom</name>
    <desc>Doom (typeset as DOOM in official documents)[1] is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game industry, for having ushered in the popularity of the first-person shooter genre. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.    In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as "Doomguy", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell.[2] With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15â€“20 million people[3] within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as "WADs". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as "Doom clones". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of controversy.    The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making WADs, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Doom motion picture. Doom 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply as Doom</desc>

    <desc>Dragon Ball Z: The Legend utilizes a unique system of play that is different from most other fighters. The graphics feature 2D sprites in a three dimensional world. Although each battle begins on the ground, the majority of the action is featured skyward.  The characters fly around each and utilize rapid punches and kicks, and Ki Blasts, either singularly or rapidly by holding the assigned button for a short period of time.  The characters have a limited amount of ki that can be charged over time. If the player uses all of their available ki, their character will stop fighting out of exhaustion, leaving them wide open for an attack. The life meter is a scale made up of energy from both sides that shifts depending on damage taken, and after one side is depleted, the character performs a special "Meteor Attack", which takes place in a cut scene and finishes off the opponent. Each match is made up of two teams that can include one fighter or multiple fighters that can be switched out at various times.</desc>

After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduced a first-person perspective to the series and turned the game in a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.  Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. As a mature game, the protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them remove their top.  The character, voiced by Jon St. John, also regularly delivers commentary on the events through one liners. There are 28 levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, nightvision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a jet pack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.  The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.</desc>

    <name>Enemy Zero</name>
    <desc>Enemy Zero is one of the horror titles by Warp, closely connected to D (and its sequel D2 for Dreamcast). It also features the same heroine as in D series.   The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.  The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</desc>

    <desc>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.  There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.  The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system  FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</desc>

It was released for the PC on June 24, 1996 and versions for PlayStation, SNES, Mega Drive and Sega Saturn followed.    FIFA 97 was the fourth game in the FIFA Series and the second to use the Virtual Stadium engine. Unlike the first game to use the engine, FIFA 97 features polygonal players as opposed to the 2D sprites used in FIFA Soccer '96. The engine however received complaints for being sluggish in the PC and PlayStation versions.    David Ginola (then a Newcastle United player) graced the cover of the game in the European market. He also was used for motion capture for the polygonal models in the game. Bebeto (the Brazilian striker) was featured on the cover for the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets.</desc>

    <name>Fighters Megamix</name>
    <desc>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter.  The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.    In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers.  Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.  Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult.  But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options.  The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.  One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.  This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.</desc>

    <desc>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.  While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw.   Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.  Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.  Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.</desc>

    <desc>Galactic Attack is a coin-op conversion of the Japanese arcade game RayForce (GunLock for European arcades). A top-down shooter, there are seven levels to play, ranging from battles in the atmosphere of planets to battling over mountain ranges, each with their own standard huge bosses at the end of each of these levels. The player takes control of a starfighter called the RVA-818 X-LAY, out to destroy any opposing forces.  The story has the future of Earth governments gathering together to construct a massive super computer called Con-Human to help with the planet's environment, providing nutrients to the earth and caring for the ecosystem. However, a cloned human is linked with the system and makes Con-Human a sentient being. The system eventually becomes insane and starts to create natural disasters, wiping all nearly all of mankind and destroying the ecosystem, driving the survivors into space to develop colonies on other planets. Con-Human then makes Earth into a giant fortress and is assembling a massive armada to destroy the remaining survivors, but before it can attack, the survivors amass a first strike in order to reclaim the Earth.  The goal is to fly around in the level, using the primary laser weapon to destroy various enemies flying in and out of the screen.  Players can upgrade this weapon by collecting "L" icons floating around when enough enemies are destroyed.  There is also a secondary weapon, a lock-on missile launcher, that has the ability to fire upon eight different ground enemies at once.</desc>

    <name>Grand Slam</name>
    <desc>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.    Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.    Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.    Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.    Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:    - A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.    - Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.    - Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.</desc>

    <name>Guardian Heroes</name>
    <desc>Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces the player to a motley crew of heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a cleric and a mage), formed to find a "legendary sword". The game begins with the heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it. Before they have a chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to take flight along with this general.  The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way you'd expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels - sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.  Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make (of which there are many) and which character you select to play with.  Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the other character by changing his "mood" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can play as any character that you have encountered during the main game mode.</desc>

    <desc>Pilot an enormous walking mech to complete missions set all over the world in late 21st century warfare fighting other mechs, trucks and helicopters. The missions, set in different weathers and at different times of day, usually have specific objectives, be they search and destroy, protecting allies or killing everything. Four weapons are available: the main cannon; a weak machine gun that overheats with prolonged use; clusters of grenades and limited supplies of homing missiles. Damage repair and extra ammo is available from supply helicopters, but these are vulnerable to attack. Ally mechs can be useful, but it is the player who has to do most of the work by far, battling mechs that are sometimes faster and more agile, therefore a certain amount of strategy and planning is required.</desc>

    <desc>Hang-On GP features three tracks: Albatross Cliff Reef, Great Crimson Wall, and New Dwells.  Each track contains an additional route that becomes available after a high placing.  This makes a total of six possible races.    Players can choose from among ten motorcycles to use during a race as well as an automatic or manual transmission for each. Players can also decide how the bike should control, highside or power slide.  Placing in the top three on any of the first three tracks will release the additional routes.  When players place in the top three on the additional routes an endurance mode will be available.  In endurance mode players attempt to complete as many laps as they can in 10 minutes.</desc>

    <desc>Hebereke's Popoitto is a Tetris variant. The goal in each level is to remove the blocks already on the playfield, representing characters from the franchise. Other blocks fall down from the top of the screen and have to be steered to the right place before touching the ground or another block. When four or more of the same blocks are together, they vanish. The catch of this variant is that the blocks which have to be removed move over the playfield. The player takes the role of the penguin Hebereke who wants to win a tournament against his friends.</desc>

    <name>Hi-Octane : The Track Fights Back!</name>
    <desc>A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a modified version of the Magic Carpet 2 engine.    Gameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling the steering and throttle, and three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.    Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).</desc>

    <name>Impact Racing</name>
    <desc>With disregard for a background story, Funcom Dublin offers a Wipeout-esque mix of racing and driving at a very fast pace. Completing laps within the allotted time does not suffice, you also need to destroy a certain amount of vehicles. Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and firewalls. Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.  Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings "city", "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the game's pace.</desc>

    <desc>This arcade game is based loosely on the 1996 blockbuster movie "Independence Day." Interspersed with cutscenes lifted from the film, the game consists of flying a jet through various missions in order to take down the gargantuan, city-destroying spaceships. This entails flying around the 3D level and taking out targets such as: communication uplinks, shield generators, the occasional alien fighter craft, and ultimately bringing down the major alien ship via a strike on its main cannon. Powerups are plentiful, such as medical packs that heal your jetcraft, bonus weapons, bonus planes, and an item that freezes enemy planes for a brief time.    Mission settings include the Grand Canyon, Washington D.C., and New York City. There are other missions that are provided on a need-to-know basis (as stated in the manual). The game also features 2-player head-to-head action via a network or null modem link.</desc>

    <name>Jewels of the Oracle</name>
    <desc>Jewels of the Oracle is a stationary puzzle game with no real story line or plot. A total of 24 ingenious puzzles must be solved, each independent of the others. Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.    The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.    The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest. The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.</desc>

    <name>Krazy Ivan</name>
    <desc>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.  The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.  The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.  After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.  Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</desc>

    <desc>The leader of Soul Crew, the toughest gang in Tokyo, was viciously killed. Shortly after that an anonymous challenge appeared in graffiti scrawls all over the city "inviting" all of the city's gang leaders to a fighting tournament that will settle which group has the power to rule Tokyo. Everyone knew refusing to participate was not an option.  Just like in Virtua Fighter 2, you fight in 3D stages and every character has its unique style and feel. But unlike the PC version of Virtua Fighter 2, where the background of every stage is a flat picture, in Last Bronx all the scenery is done in 3D. Plus, you can taunt your opponent during the fight!</desc>

    <name>Magic Carpet</name>
    <desc>Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called "worlds"; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to "restore the equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level.   To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect "your" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the "castle" spell at it to make it bigger.   The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors.   There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though.   Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.</desc>

    <desc>The balance in the magical world of Cefiro is supported by the prayers of the lovely princess Emerald. When the evil Sage Master imprisoned her, the existence of the entire world was endangered. Using her spiritual powers, the princess contacted three Japanese high-school girls, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, turned them into Magic Knights, and summoned them to Cefiro, where their goal is to save her and to restore the balance.  This adaptation of the eponymous manga and anime series is an action adventure, somewhat similar in style to  Zelda games. The protagonists are all the three girls, but the player can controls only one of them at a time. Each one has advantages and disadvantages, as well as different fighting styles: Hikaru uses swords, Umi a rapier, and Fuu a bow. The player advances through the game by exploring the world, talking to non-playable characters, and fighting enemies in real-time combat. There is no experience system; new abilities (among them swimming and jumping) are gained as dictated by the story, and must be used in certain points in order to advance.</desc>

    <desc>Marvel Super Heroes is a 2D fighting game and the second Capcom title to feature characters from the Marvel comic universe. The gameplay is very similar to X-Men: Children of the Atom, but with a simplified Super Combo gauge and the addition of infinity gems. Each character starts with a set of gems. These can be activated during a fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a rift in space, or reverse the opponent's controls. The use of the gems is inspired by the The Infinity Gauntlet comic book series.  There are ten playable characters. The heroes are Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Psylocke, Spider-Man and Wolverine. The villains are Blackheart, Juggernaut, Magneto and Shuma-Gorath. Anita from the Darkstalkers series is a hidden character in the Japanese version. The bosses are Doctor Doom and Thanos. During the boss fight Thanos steals all the player's gems (except for mind) and uses them with new effects.</desc>

    <desc>You are the genetically engineered Clan Mechwarrior. The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!    Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the "par" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.</desc>

    <desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.  Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.  The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.  The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.  As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.</desc>

    <desc>The young sorceress Nikki, the court jester Fargus, and his side-kick Sid the puppet are the three main protagonists of this 3D platform game. While attending a "Wizards in Training" seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.  The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.  Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

    <desc>Flash backwards to several years before the vicious battle against the empire in Panzer Dragoon 1. In the country of Machania, dragons are bred for the exclusive use of the dragoons, or Knights. Dragons with wings are normally executed as they are deemed to be a bad omen by the citizens. In the war with the Empire, Machania has begun to examine the ancient ways rather than to try to fight a futile war using technological advances. The Empire is technologically more advanced. Randy, the hero, and his newfound friend, the dragon he saved, want to turn the tide of battle.</desc>

    <desc>Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but it differs from the rest of the series by having strong RPG elements.  The hero of the game is Edge, one of the soldiers of the mighty Empire. The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and to avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict... or are there more?  "Panzer Dragon Saga" combines elements of shooter and role-playing. You don't have a party in the game: you control only Edge on his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. You move around through the game's fully 3D world by flying on the dragon. In towns and some dungeons you also move on foot. During battles, you can shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of your dragons. You shoot in real time, and can also move around to attack your enemies from the sides of from the back, or to avoid their attacks. The dragon gets experience points for fighting and also gains levels. You will be able to customize your dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</desc>

    <name>Quake</name>
    <desc>An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.  id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.  In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.  Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.  The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.  Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.</desc>

The game was developed on a budget of two million dollars.[1] The video footage was filmed over two weeks.[1] When asked if it was difficult to call up his usual energy when working with a film crew instead of a real game-day situation, Mike Ditka said, "I've been called a lot of things, and being called 'an actor' has been one of them. It's not that hard to do, really."[2]    Footage from the game was used in the film Game Over.</desc>

Hitachi, manufacturers of the HiSaturn, noted that the game did not run correctly on their variant of the console, leaving the developers (Prolific) waiting for a HiSaturn console to test the game on. After this setback the game's publisher, Williams Entertainment, decided to avoid publishing games for the Saturn, and hence the project was effectively scrapped. Other versions of the game were released, however, including a version for the PlayStation.</desc>

    <path>./Road Rash (USA).chd</path>
    <name>Road Rash</name>
    <desc>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.   There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.  There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.  If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.  The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</desc>

    <path>./Robo Pit (USA).chd</path>
    <name>Robo Pit</name>
    <desc>Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.  Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!  The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.</desc>

    <name>Robotica</name>
    <desc>Robotica was the first firstperson shooter for the platform and a first generation game for the console. It is somewhat similar to Space Hulk, only that the player takes the role of a machine that rebels against the robots to save mankind. The weapons include a punch, Vulcan gun, Missiles, and Lasers. The main environment is made up of various hallways. The player runs through the various stages collecting keys, using computers, and triggering lights. The enemies are relatively basic but are dangerous in numbers.  The game is set in 2877, 800 years after the world's peacekeeping unions have collapsed. They are replaced with World Silent Security Service, a global world order to maintain the security on earth and in space. However, over time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player gets to control the remaining robot.</desc>

After Burner II allows you to fly the most feared jet fighter in the skies - the SSF-14 - and annihilate the enemy. With two Vulcan guns, heat seaking missiles and an afterburner, as well as support from the crew of the aircraft carrier Sega Enterprise, the object is to shoot the enemy from the sky - before they get you.

    <name>Sega Touring Car Championship</name>
    <desc>After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega.   Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an "Arcade" and a "PC"/"Saturn" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player. As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.  Another feature was the "Global Ranking" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only "Global Net Events".</desc>

    <desc>Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 (known as Sega Worldwide Soccer PC for the PC and Victory Goal Worldwide Edition in Japan) is a football video game by Sega released for the Sega Saturn in 1996. It is the successor to Victory Goal and was later followed by three more titles: Sega Worldwide Soccer '98 still on the 32-bit console and two editions of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000, the second being Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 Euro Edition for the Dreamcast.    Sega Worldwide Soccer 97, produced by Sega themselves was one of the killer apps in the peak of popularity for the console.[1] It was preceded by Victory Goal, an already ageing football game (one of the debut titles of the console). The game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until ISS 64 was released one year later. Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 was later ported to the PC, under the title of Sega Worldwide Soccer PC.</desc>

You are a rookie hired by the tank force and must prove yourself in 25 increasingly difficult missions.  'The Pen' is Da Wardenz' headquarters. It has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing room and various lockers (used for loading and saving missions). Before a mission, you can explore the headquarters and interact with each member of the team; you may learn something.  When you start a mission, the action is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has you controlling the M-13 Predator, a highly sophisticated and upgradable tank. The game is arcade-oriented and has much more in common with 'Quarantine' and 'Doom' than serious counterparts like 'M1 Tank Platoon'. Your tank has unlimited bullets, can sustain heavy damage and can destroy enemies but also trees and buildings.  When a mission is successfully completed you earn cash which you can spend on repairing your tank and extra upgrades.</desc>

    <name>Shining Force III</name>
    <desc>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.  The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences.   The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.  It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.</desc>

    <name>Shining the Holy Ark</name>
    <desc>Part of the Shining game universe, "Shining the Holy Ark" is a pure console-style RPG (unlike  Shining Force games, that were strategy/RPG hybrids). You play the role of a young swordsman Arthur, who decided to work as a mercenary for various people needing his services. On his first mission, the King of Enrich sends him to a mine, in order to find and punish a renegade ninja who has escaped from him. However, an accident occurs that makes Arthur realize that he'll have to do much more than his usual mercenary assignment, and that there is a true evil in the world that must be defeated at all costs.  The game features 3D graphics and utilizes first-person perspective for dungeons and battles. The turn-based battles are of a traditional Japanese RPG kind, except the addition of "Pixie System". In various places in the game you can find pixies who can later be used as allies in battles.</desc>

    <desc>Sonic 3D Blast, also known as Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island, is a 1996 platform video game developed by Traveller's Tales and Sonic Team, and published by Sega for the Genesis, Saturn, and Windows. Part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game abandons previous Sonic games' side-scrolling style in favor of isometric gameplay, making use of some pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The game features creatures known as Flickies, which first appeared in the 1984 arcade game Flicky. Controlling only Sonic himself, the player's goal is to collect Flickies and carry them to safety, periodically sparring with the series antagonist Dr. Robotnik, who is imprisoning them within robots.    While 3D Blast was initially created for the Genesis Sega also commissioned a port for the Saturn as a backup plan in case Sonic X-treme could not be released in time for the Holiday season.</desc>

For 20,000 years mankind has expanded forth throughout the galaxy aided by a phenomenal invention known as the Warp Drive, which allows huge spatial distances to be traversed in a matter of hours. Under the auspices of the Emperor; a psychic so powerful he is essentially immortal, a pan-galactic Imperium has been established in which mankind has spread and prospered. The defenders of the Imperium are the Adeptus Astartes, or Space Marines, bio-genetically engineered warriors of superhuman prowess, ever vigilant to destroy the many threats that face mankind across the cosmos.  The player is one such Space Marine, belonging to one of the oldest and most honourable Chapters known as the Blood Angels, whose battle honours date back as long as the Imperium has existed. He finds him/herself assigned to the Terminator company. Among the thousand warriors that compose a Space Marine Chapter, only the hundred most valorous and gifted brothers are deemed worthy enough of this honour. Terminators are the Chapter's ultimate warriors. They are protected by suits that make them all but impervious to conventional weaponry, and armed with the most devastating weaponry available.</desc>

    <name>Space Jam</name>
    <desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.  The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.  Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.  The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.  The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.  There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.  The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.  There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</desc>

New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.  The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</desc>

    <desc>A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.  Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</desc>

A year later a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a part of their Greatest Hits line-up and featured several modifications to the game play.    The player takes control of characters struggling to survive on INGenâ€™s â€œSite Bâ€  populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. While the game is in 3D, the game play resembles early 2D platformers in which you generically either go left or right, limiting the mobility of each character.</desc>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.  Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.  You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.  It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

    <name>Three Dirty Dwarves</name>
    <desc>Three Dirty Dwarves is a side-scrolling action game with an interesting plot: genetically altered "super kids" playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons open a portal that allows their "alter-egos" (the three dirty dwarves) to enter our world and try to rescue them from their evil Army Base captivity.  Once the dwarves arrive, they ransack the local "armory" (a sporting goods store) for weapons and set off to rescue the kids. The portal also lets in a number of fantasy bad guys too and they must be squashed on the way.  The main game mechanics allows the player to switch between each dwarf and uses its special attack (e. g. baseball bat and baseballs, bowling pins and bowling balls, and a shotgun). Additionally, there is the DwarfMorph" attack where the dwarves act as one.</desc>

    <desc>Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq.    Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC &amp; Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.</desc>

    <desc>Hardcore 4x4 (initially known as TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 in the US and known as Deka Yonku ~Tough The Truck~in Japan) is a racing video game developed by Gremlin Interactive for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It became available for download from PlayStation Store as a PSone Classic for play on the PlayStation 3 on January 10, 2008, in PAL regions.[4] The game utilizes 3D environments and truck models. The soundtrack features hard rock music. It was the first game to feature vehicles with independent suspension.[citation needed]    In 1996, ASC (publisher) hired Top Dog Entertainment in Austin, Texas, to develop Hardcore 4x4 II (the second version). The first Sony PlayStation developer in the Americas, Brett Butler, was lead programmer. He travelled to England to collect the game code and world builder tools. Both were defective, so he spent the first month repairing the code base. He then designed new tracks, rebuilt the graphics engine in MIPS RISC R3000 assembly, and hired artists and designers to create new tracks, menu interfaces, and vehicles. The title was completed in late 1997 as Top Dog went out of business shortly after Brett Butler left the company.[citation needed]</desc>

    <desc>Lara Croft is a Tomb Raider, an archaeologist who explores ancient sites in search of valuable artifacts.  In the game, Lara Croft is hired to retrieve an artifact from a tomb in Peru, which turns out to be one of three parts of the Atlantean Scion.  Soon betrayed by her employer, Lara Croft travels to Greece, Rome and Egypt to recover the other parts before this powerful device falls into the wrong hands.  Tomb Raider is a 3D action/adventure game in which players control Lara Croft from a third person perspective.  The camera follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs overcoming environmental obstacles and deadly fauna.  Moving through levels often involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where Lara can use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve puzzles and open passageways.  Lara is armed with, now trademark, twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents.  Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient herself.  Lara’s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural beings.  Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.</desc>

The game retains the character roster of Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors, omitting Donovan, Huitzil and Pyron from the lineup. Taking their place were four new characters: Jedah, Lilith, Q-Bee and B. B. Hood. It also features a secret character/mode, Shadow, where the player assumes the identity of the defeated character for the next fight (e.g. if Morrigan is defeated, the next fight the player will play as Morrigan).    Vampire Savior eschews the traditional round-based system in favour of what is dubbed the "Damage Gauge System", where battles take place during a period of one round, with each fighter having two "life markers" (equivalent to two life bars) by default, which diminish after one character runs out of vitality. The player can also regain a portion of their life during battle if they manage to avoid taking further hits. The game also introduces the "Dark Force System" which allows players to perform special abilities unique to each character for a limited period.</desc>

Dropped into a series of locations, one or two players must arm up and shoot their way through three death filled levels, in an attempt to restore peace and order. Played from a first person perspective view, players can use keys or joypad, to aim and fire at the multitude of sharp shooters who come gunning for them. Starting the game armed with just a trusty old six-shooter, players can pick up more powerful, state-of-the-art weapons -- such as machine guns and shotguns -- as they progress. As these are hidden away in crates and the like, finding these weapons is an important part of the game and they can give players extra firepower when they most need it. In particular, such weapons can be extremely useful when trying to take on the customary end-of-level bosses. Made of stern stuff, you'll need all the help you can get in dispatching them off to hell.</desc>

Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.  Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.  While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps  to bring the arcade experience home.</desc>

    <name>Virtua Racing</name>
    <desc>Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed by Sega AM2 and released in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience</desc>

    <desc>Virtual Hydlide is a 3D remake of the original Hydlide for the NES. You must defeat the evil demon Varalys, who turned a beautiful princess into three fairies. Before you confront the ultimate fiend, you must find the three fairies and restore the princess to her normal self by collecting three jewels.  You roam the 3D world of Hydlide, fighting monsters in real time, finding weapons and armor, descending into dungeons, hunting for treasure, and collecting points after defeating your foes, which you can then exchange for items. RPG elements are very slight, as you level up only after completing a portion of the game. You can also generate random maps by yourself and let the hero perform the same quest in your own world.</desc>

    <desc>In 1995 the increased power of the new wave of systems made 3D football games a possibility several companies investigated. Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles.    Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players, each with 8 individual skill attributes, were featured. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top. A full range of customised tournaments were available, as well as multi-player options allowing for both same-system and networked play.</desc>

    <name>Whizz</name>
    <desc>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</desc>

    <path>./Winter Heat (USA).chd</path>
    <name>Winter Heat</name>
    <desc>Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena).   The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:  1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.  2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).  3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.  4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.  5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.  6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.  7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a "click-along" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses  8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.  9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.  10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.  11. Cross Country:  The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.</desc>

    <desc>WipEout XL is set in the year 2097, around four decades after its predecessor. Instead of the F3600 anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.  Each vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.</desc>

    <desc>Wipeout is a futuristic racing game set in the year 2052. Racing for one of four teams, the player competes in the F3600 Anti-Gravity Racing League on six tracks. Each team's hovercraft racer has different ratings in speed, acceleration and turning. In addition to high-speed racing, there is also shooting in the game, with different weapon pickups like rockets and mines available, useful for slowing one's opponents down. Shields can also be picked up and can block the weapons' effects.  There are championship, single race and time trial modes. Winning the championship in the regular Venom class unlocks the Rapier class, where the craft are faster and the tracks have slightly different looks.  There is also a two-player mode where two opponents can race and shoot at each other.</desc>

    <name>Worms</name>
    <desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.  Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.   There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.  There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

    <name>Z</name>
    <desc>  Z is a real-time strategy game in which you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories that can gain you additional units. Touch the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base, and prevent him from doing the same to you.</desc>
