		<name>Videocart-11: Backgammon, Acey-Deucey</name>
		<desc>The original game of backgammon for the first 2nd-generation console of 1977.  Players take turn rolling dice and then moving their pieces around the game board.  Blue &amp; Red each have to move all their pieces off the board to win, and are competing against each other and against lady luck herself.    Acey-Deucey is another way to play Backgammon where the starting position is different.  Instead of starting the game with numerous pieces arranged at places around the board, you start with all your pieces at the starting line.  It makes for a longer game, although just as strategic and challenging.</desc>

One player takes to the field, the other grabs a bat and steps up to the plate.  The pitcher can throw fast, slow, and some wicked curves even at the last moment.  Luckily the single-button swing action makes hitting the ball fairly easy, even if getting a single is harder than hitting a double or home-run.</desc>

		<desc>This cart contains two different games.  The first game is Robot War. It takes place on a space station. The computer malfunctioned and now four robots are out to hunt down the player. Gameplay mainly has the player trying to trick the pursuing robots into one of the four electrified force fields littered throughout the playfield. Every time the player is touched by a robot, one of the force fields disappear. Once all the force fields disappear, the player loses a point to the robots. If all the robots are defeated, the player gets a point for that round. The game also features an option for two players, where the second player takes control of the robots. The game features four game speeds from slowest to fastest  The other game is Torpedo Alley. Players control a shore battery at the bottom of the screen and shoot at an invading fleet of ships above them. Each hit ship is worth a different amount of points, with the lowest ship being worth 1 point, the middle ship worth 3 points, and the highest ship worth 5 points. The game ends when a player reaches 99 points or the adjustable time limit expires.</desc>

		<desc>Sonar Search features the basic gameplay idea of Battleship, but with a unique twist. Instead of trying to randomly guess what grid an opponent's battleship is on, after the player takes a shot, the player will hear a  sonar ping noise. The shorter the noise, the closer the player is to hitting a target.  In the 1 player game, the player has a limited number of chances to sink the enemy fleet of ships, while in the 2 player game,  players take turns trying to sink their opponents ships before  having their own ships sunk.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-16: Dodge-It</name>
		<desc>The gameplay featured on this cart is a take on the game of Dodgeball. The player is trapped inside a playfield and has to dodge a ball that continuously keeps bouncing of the sides of the playfield. The longer the player is able to dodge the ball, the more points are earned. After a certain amount of points are earned, another ball enters the playfield thus making the player have to dodge two balls. More balls keep getting added at fixed intervals after that until a total of 9 balls enter the playfield. The game ends when the player is finally hit by the ball.  In the 2 player game, both players are put into the same playfield and try to outlast the other player in not trying to get hit by the balls being thrown by the computer.  The game features random variations in the gameplay, such as having different sized playfields, ball sizes and speeds, and changing the players size and speed.   The game features four different modes which are either a 1 or 2 player Amateur mode or a 1 or 2 player Pro mode.</desc>

		<path>./Pinball Challenge (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Videocart-17: Pinball Challenge</name>
		<desc>Although the title of the game may lead players to believe it's a pinball game, in actuality it is a game more heavily inspired by Breakout. The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points with the low green bricks being worth 1 point each, the middle blue bricks being worth 4 points each, and the red bricks on top being worth 7 points each. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, its up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. The player loses a life if they happen to miss a ball with their paddle and the ball falls into the abyss. The game ends when the player loses 7 balls. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side that the ball can bounce off of are labeled side rails, and the paddle is referred to as a flipper.  The game offers 132 game variations of this basic gameplay idea.  Games modes include Pinball Wiz, Crossover, Blok-Shot, Cooperation, Pro Challenge,  and Double Blok with each having variations which can include different sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even a variation where the paddle shrinks each time the ball is hit.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-18: Hangman</name>
		<desc>This game lets the player play the classic game of Hangman, in which the player is given an unknown word of a certain length and has to guess the correct letters that are contained in the unknown word. The player is only allowed a certain number of turns in which to guess these correct letters. Every incorrect guess will add a body part to a drawing of a man being hanged at the gallows. Once all the man's body parts are drawn from several incorrect guesses, he is hanged and the player loses.  The game contains 64 game variations of this basic premise for either 1 or 2 players, with or without a score. Variations include having the computer come up with a word to guess, have a player come up with a word for another player to solve, free letter which gives the player one of the letters in the word to help them get started, a variation where the game will tell the player they guessed the right letter but will not say where it belongs in a word, a version where the player is not told how long the word trying to be solved is, a version where the player has to guess the correct letter plus place it correctly where it belongs in a word, and a variation where the player has to solve an anagram.</desc>

		<desc>This game features a playable version of the board game Checkers. Players control the 12 checkers at the bottom of the screen and attempt to remove the 12 checkers at the top of the screen which are controlled by a computer opponent. Players can only move their checkers diagonally toward their opponents side of the board. A checker can be jumped when two opposing checkers are next to each other and there is an empty space on the diagonal of the checker getting jumped. If a checker is put into a position of being able to be jumped it must be jumped. If a checker happens to reach the other side of the board, that checker is kinged and is allowed to move both back and forth in diagonal movements. The game is won by the player who removes all their opponents checkers from the board.</desc>

		<desc>Videocart-2 features two game programs:  1. Desert Fox: In this game you control one of two tanks engaged in a battle. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting your opponent. On the game screen there are two barriers (located in the upper left and bottom right corners) and five mines (located in the middle of the screen). The tanks can not shoot through the barriers or mines making them ideal for cover. The tanks can drive through the barriers, but attempting to drive through a mine will cause your tank to explode awarding your opponent a point. 2. Shooting Gallery: In this game you control a rifle on the left side of the screen and need to hit a target on the right side of the screen. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by hitting the target with as few misses as possible. You can play with no time limit at an average speed, or increase the challenge by adding a time limit and increasing the game speed. This game can also be played by two players to see who can score the most hits.</desc>

		<desc>Schach (German for "chess") was released for the Saba Videoplay, a Channel F-compatible system that Fairchild licensed for the European market.    In this early chess simulation you can only play against the machine, as there is no multiplayer support. The player can chose either the white (actually green on screen) or black (actually red) pieces, and can select from 4 different AI difficulties. The easiest AI plays its turns in a matter of seconds but, as the difficulty increases, each turn can take several minutes. In the highest difficulty, the AI can take up to 50(!) minutes to decide its move. To allow the player to watch something else on the TV while the system is busy, the game cart has a very special feature: an integrated red led lights up while the machine is "thinking".</desc>

		<desc>Video Whizball is a game where players control paddles that have to protect a goal from being entered by whizballs. To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled up or downward. Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel them to start going in an opposite direction. If one of the missiles (or whizballs for that matter) hit the player's paddle or an opponent's paddle, their paddle will temporarily disappear leaving their goal undefended. The game is won when either one of the players gets to a selected score.  The game contains 72 game variations of this basic premise. Variations includes having from 1 to 4 whizballs (the game cart also refers to these as boulders by the way), and having 6 different game types. Game types are Basic where each whizball is worth only 1 point, Basic Plus where players can guide the missile shots into the whizballs, Bonus where whizballs can be numbered 1 thru 4 and are worth that many points each, Bonus Plus which adds guided missiles to the Bonus game type, Super Bonus where whizballs increase in value from 1 to 9 points the longer they stay in play, and Super Bonus Plus which adds guided missile shots to the Super Bonus game type.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-21: Bowling</name>
		<desc>The object of the game is to knock down as many pins in 10 frames of bowling, The game gives the player an overhead view of a bowling lane. The player's bowling ball starts out moving back and forth across the front of the lane. This has the player trying to get the lane position they want the ball to start traveling down. Once the ball starts rolling down the lane, the player can curve the ball left or right. Once the curve has started, it can't be changed further.  The game contains 18 game variations. They involve choosing the combination of number of players (1 or 2 players), playing either a regular or split game, and then choosing the speed of play (slow,normal,fast, and fastest).  The regular game, just like it sounds like, is a regular game of bowling featuring the usual rules of play.  The split game has each frame starting  with some combination of less than 10 pins. The player has 2 balls to knock down the remaining pins in each frame.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-23: Galactic Space Wars, Lunar Lander</name>
		<desc>This game cart contains two space themed games.  In Galactic Space Wars, players take control of a fighter spacecraft with the sole objective to find and destroy enemy spacecrafts.  Players take a first person perspective from inside the cockpit of the space fighter searching the vast area of space in order to locate enemy craft. Once an enemy craft is located, players try to quickly scroll the enemy ship into their lasers sight. If the enemy stays on the screen to long, it will be able to fire a shot at the player's ship and score a hit. There are four different types of enemy crafts each worth a varying amount of points for being destroyed. The player is given a limited amount of time to destroy as many ships as possible and to try not to let the enemy ships get hits on their spacecraft.  Lunar Lander seems to have been inspired by the same titled arcade game Lunar Lander. Players pilot a lunar lander and attempt to have a soft landing on a landing platform. The lunar lander only has a certain amount of fuel to maneuver around with thus adding to the challenge. The key is to have a soft landing by gently and smoothly lowering the lander onto the platform, as landing coming down too fast or missing the platform entirely crashes the lunar lander. Their is also a timer keeping count of the amount of time it takes for the player to land the lunar lander. The objective is to land the craft in the least amount of time possible.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-4: Spitfire</name>
		<desc>Videocart-4 features the action game Spitfire. This is an aerial dogfighting game that pits the Red Baron against the Blue Max. The goal is to try to shoot down your opponent to score a point, and the player with the most points wins. Viewed from the side, your bi-planes have the freedom to fly anywhere on the screen; the screen wraps, so if you fly off of one side you will appear again on the other side. You can also hide just off screen to attempt to sneak up on an opponent; be careful, even though you may not be visible you are still vulnerable to attacks! The game can be played by two players against each other, or one player against the computer. When playing against the computer, the computer's skill level will vary throughout the game; the more times you are successful in shooting down the computer, the more its skill level will increase! However the more the computer shoots you down, the more its skill level will decrease.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-5: Space War</name>
		<desc>Videocart-5: Space War is an action game where two players each control spaceships. The goal is to destroy your opponents ship by depleting its energy supply; success will earn you a point. Each ship is capable of flying anywhere on the screen and is also equipped with lasers for attacking your opponent. At the beginning of the game each spaceship has 90 energy units; when no energy is left that  ship will be destroyed. Energy can be depleted in two ways: 2 points are used up every time you fire your lasers, and 5 points are lost if hit by enemy laser fire. Should your energy level drop to 10 points or less, you will be unable to fire your lasers; this prevents you from accidentally obliterating your own spaceship! Energy units can be replenished by flying through one of the two starbases located at opposite ends of the screen.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-8: Magic Numbers</name>
		<desc>Videocart-8 contains two traditional number games: Mind Reader and Nim.  1. Mind Reader is a numerical version of the popular combination guessing game most commonly known as Master Mind. The console chooses a random number with 2 to 5 digits, according to player selection. The player is given 20 chances to guess the number the console has chosen. After every guess, the display shows how many numbers were correctly placed, and how many numbers are correct but in the wrong spot. Every wrong guess increases the computer's score by one, and finding the code increases the player's score by the number of remaining guesses. The goal is to reach 100 points before the computer does. An alternative game mode gives the player a time limit instead of a limited number of trials.  2. Nim is a single-player adaptation of a traditional 2-player number game. According to the game options, there are 3, 6, or 9 piles on screen, each with 1 to 15 elements, as designated by the numbers on screen. The player and the console now take turns at removing arbitrary numbers of elements from the piles. They have to remove at least 1 element, and they can only remove elements from one pile in any turn. The side that gets to remove the last element from the playing field, wins the round. Winning a round is rewarded with a predefined number of points, and the goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. The game can also be played with a time limit, which increases the points awarded per round.</desc>

		<name>Videocart-9: Drag Strip</name>
		<desc>This drag racing simulator makes use of the Channel F's special controllers. While twisting the joystick's head to the left or right controls the engine throttle, the stick movement itself is used to shift gears in a realistic H-pattern.  Depending on the chosen skill level the car available is a family sedan, a modified sedan, a funny car, or a real dragster, although they all look the same on screen. One player can try to beat the predefined par time of 7.7 seconds, or compete against a friend to see who reaches the finish line first. The game manual mentions that a player only wins the game when he brings his victory counter to 99.</desc>

		<desc>Poor little mice, doomed to run around in a maze and escape as quickly as they can.  As if that's not enough, the owner's of this maze pit you against a friend to see who will escape first.  And then the diabolical owners take it one step further and add a cat to the maze mix -- forcing you not only to escape first, but escape alive!  This game contains a few variations:  A straight maze run, a jailbreak maze (break through each square), an invisible maze, and a hidden maze (eat your way through I guess).  In all the variations you can choose between 1-4 speeds and/or throw the cat in the maze for an extra challenge.</desc>

		<desc>This game features a simulation of the card game five-card draw poker. 3 players (either 1 or 2 can be human, the rest are controlled by the computer) are dealt five cards each. Players then take turns either calling or raising a bet (which can be up to $25), or if they don't like their cards they can fold. Once that round of betting is done players then can choose to discard up to three of their cards in exchange for three new cards in an attempt to make a better hand. Another round of betting then takes place and after that all the players that didn't fold their hands show their cards and whoever has the highest hand wins all the money in the pot.</desc>
